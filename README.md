## Why We use React in learning management sytem
There are many different types of learning management systems (LMS), but they all have one common goal: to provide a platform where learners can access and interact with educational content. A good LMS will offer features like course creation and organization,  assessment tools, and social learning features. React is a great option for developing an LMS because it offers so many ways to customize the user experience.

There are many features that make our lms good, but here are some of the most important ones:
